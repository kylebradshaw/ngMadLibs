## Refactor2

*On page load, the user should be presented with a UI like the first sketch above.
*When they click "Generate My Mad Lib," the app should validate that the user has supplied a value for each of the text inputs. If the user is missing an input, the app should provide feedback about this. (It's up to you to define what that content is and how and where it should appear.)
*All inputs are required.
*Validate the huge number field to ensure the user has input a number.
*If submitted form passes validation, the first view should be hidden, and the user should see the second view, with the word values they plugged in displayed in the appropriate locations.
*At the bottom of the Mad Lib display interface, there should be a reset button that the user can click to start over. Without refreshing the page, this button should take the user back to the first view, and zero out the word values.

1. roll back to individual inputs
